Some days ago, a friend of mine came up with a random question:

> Do you know how old you are on Mars?

"Well" -- I said -- "I'm **twenty**, so I guess I'm going to be the same on Mars". He replied that I was wrong and that on Mars Iâ€™m about **ten years old**. I was intrigued by his response, so I did some researches and found out that he was actually **right**.

So, the big question is: **why?**

Our age is the **period of our life**, measured by years, months and days, from the **day of our birth**. As you might already know, **a day** represents the average length of the period during which the Earth makes **one rotation on its axis**, while **a year** represents the time required for the Earth to complete **one revolution around the Sun**. Each **celestial object** has a **different rotation and revolution time** though, so our **age** is actually **different on each of them**. To prove how much the time can be relative, I decided to create a simple web application that shows you how old you are on each renowned celestial object.

You can find the web app on [the projects section](https://giorgio.garasto.me/en/projects) of my portfolio (or [at this link](https://projects.dabolus.app/planet-age) if you're lazy).

Just for reference, here is the table with the rotation and revolution times used on the web app:

| **Celestial object** | **Rotation time (days)** | **Revolution time (days)** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Earth**            | 0.99726968               | 365.256363004              |
| **Moon**             | 27.321661                | 27.321661                  |
| **Jupiter**          | 0.41354167               | 4332.59                    |
| **Mars**             | 1.025957                 | 686.971                    |
| **Mercury**          | 58.646                   | 87.9691                    |
| **Neptune**          | 0.6713                   | 60182                      |
| **Pluto**            | 6.38723                  | 90560                      |
| **Saturn**           | 0.43958333               | 10759.22                   |
| **Uranus**           | 0.71833                  | 30688.5                    |
| **Venus**            | 243.025                  | 224.701                    |
