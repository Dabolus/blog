    It is often said that it is wrong to reinvent the wheel, but the advanced tires 
    that we have today would not exist if someone had not tried to rethink the way 
    wheels were built. This series is about rebuilding existing technologies from 
    scratch to understand how they work, finding their gotchas, and possibly finding 
    ways to improve them.
